- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @moditha-piyumal
- I started coding because I wanted to make a difference. My current profession and my degree qualifications do not help me to follow a path that would truly fullfil my dreams and allow me to make a meaningful change in this world.
- I started learning HTML and CSS. Now I am good at both and Bootstrap as well.
- But, I want to be a programmer to create this dream project of mine which can change the lives of so many people for the better, although it may not be the most profitable.
- So, I am learning javascript and hoping to excel in react.
- This will be an updating readme!
